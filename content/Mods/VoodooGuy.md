#  VoodooGuy Mod Service Record

#  July 21, 2023- Served during r/Place 2023 as a Wartime Moderator
Before becoming a moderator in full, Voodoo Guy served as a wartime moderator in support of American Flag in Place during the r/Place 2023 event. Took part in leading diplomatic efforts, helping Mr. Skips in the Diplomatic Division throughout the event with distinction. Received the Diplomatic Division 2023 Award for services rendered.

# September 6, 2023- Promoted to the Rank of Secret Service
For extraordinary conduct in the line of duty as a member of the AmericanFlaginPlace wartime staff, VoodooGuy, upon conferring with President GitNuked and the Senate, was tendered the offer to join the regular staff. Voodoo Guy accepted on September 6, 2023, beginning service from thereon.

# September 17, 2023 - Proposed Idea of Inter-Coalition Events
On this day, VoodooGuy brought up the proposal of working with servers in the Coalition -- American Flag in Place's alliance during the r/Place 2023 period -- during the meeting on that day. The idea was discussed, but ultimately not taken at that time due to other ventures taking precedence. Although the idea was sidelined at the time, it became a later inspiration for future projects with UKPlace and other servers. In taking initiative to remain diplomatically involved, VoodooGuy shaped server outreach and events substantially, on top of other contemporary proposals. On September 30, 2023, VoodooGuy spoke with the Moderators Assembled about an opportunity to join the Nordics server for a movie night as part of our diplomatic efforts. It marked the first real opportunity for American Flag in Place to run an event with another place server.

# November 19, 2023 - Helped Found the Place United Nations
Going on his own initiative with support from the new State Department, VoodooGuy reached out to members of the Place United Nations and helped found that organization. On May 1, 2024, that server has now reached over 1.2 million members. VoodooGuy played a major role in supporting the diplomatic affairs of the American Flag in Place, putting AFIP at the center of a major growing organization.

# December 1, 2023 to January 7, 2024 - Winter Charity 2023
As a moderator during that time, Voodoo Guy became involved in the AmericanFlaginPlace Winter Charity 2023. Although not able to participate through many events during the charity, VoodooGuy remained active and took part in supporting pixel placing at the conclusion of the event, where artwork commemorating the $1419.75 raised was added to the American flag on Pixel Canvas.

# January 15, 2024 - Promotion to the Rank of General
For substantial services rendered during time as a moderator, consistent dedication to the strictures of the moderation staff, and support for our goals, VoodooGuy obtained promotion to the rank of General of the Pixel Patriots on January 15, 2024.

# April 1, 2024 - French Flag in Place Committee
For April Fool's Day 2024, VoodooGuy became involved in efforts to organize a special event on AmericanFlaginPlace, whereby the server would become 'French Flag in Place' after a coup d'état by the French under President El Mosquito. The event would be highly successful, garnering 10,000 messages in a single day to amount to one of the largest (if not the largest) non-r/Place message counts in AmericanFlaginPlace history.

# May 1, 2024 - Retirement from AFIP Moderation
On May 1, 2024, Voodoo Guy retired from the moderation team, having achieved the rank of General of the Pixel Patriots during time served. Throughout VoodooGuy's time as a moderator, Voodoo showed an immense dedication to those around him, working to always brighten one's day with messages and a positive attitude. With a substantial list of contributions in tow, VoodooGuy officially left the moderation team on this day.
