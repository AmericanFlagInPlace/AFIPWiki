# PancakeKing Mod Service Record

### October 28, 2023 - Inducted as a Moderator
Having found application to be satisfactory after review by the Senate of the Pixel Patriots, PancakeKing entered into the ranks of moderators as a member of the Secret Service on October 28, 2023. Prior to this, PancakeKing was known for posts related to the baseball team known as the Chicago White Sox.

## December 2, 2023 - Pledged to Change Profile for Winter Charity
At a meeting on this day, PancakeKing made the decision to sacrifice his account for charity as part of the American Flag in Place Winter Charity 2023. Because the point at which the goal was supposed to be set was already matched by that point, it was met before it could be put on the goals. PancakeKing did so anyway, changing his profile to 'WaffleQueen' and losing his Discord username temporarily in the process in a point of dedication to the cause (lol).

## February 21, 2024 - Promoted to the Rank of General
For showing a clear and present dedication to the situation on American Flag in Place, and in showing an interest in upholding and improving upon our standards and server's quality, PancakeKing was promoted to the rank of General of the Pixel Patriots on this day.
