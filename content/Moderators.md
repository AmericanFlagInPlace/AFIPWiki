Through the history of American Flag in Place, many moderators have come and gone. In recognition of the immense service of many of our staff and remembrance of all those who have helped make the AFIP of today, let all witness the long roll of moderators below who have made it possible. For early moderators, some threads will be doubled up and link to multiple threads in order to make sure that we can fit ones who may have been missed on the first pass chronologically
